# Differential-Input-Oscilloscope
Unlike a single-ended oscilloscope which can measure only the potential difference between the Ground and a node, it can measure the voltage difference between any two nodes and significant work has been done to make a current sensor that does not draw any current into it.
It is highly portable and can work using normal 5V mobile charger.
